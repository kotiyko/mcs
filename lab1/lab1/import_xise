Description:

  Imports an ISE project file (XISE) into the current project. This allows
  ISE projects to be quickly migrated for synthesis, simulation, and
  implementation. All project source files, constraint files, simulation
  files, and run settings are imported from the ISE project and recreated in
  the current project.

  This command should be run on a new empty project. Since source files,
  constraints, and run settings are imported from the ISE project, any
  existing source files or constraints may be overwritten.


Arguments:

  -copy_sources - Copy source files in the ISE project to the local project
  directory structure rather than referencing them from their current
  location. The default is to reference source files from their current
  location.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_limit command.

  <file> - The name of the ISE project file (.XISE) to be imported into the
  current project.


Examples:

  The following example creates a new project called importISE, and then
  imports the ISE project file (first_use.xise) into the new project.

    create_project importISE C:/Data/importISE import_xise \
    C:/Data/FPGA_design/ise_designs/drp_des/first_use.xise

  Note: This example does not specify the -copy_sources argument, so all
  source files in the ISE project will be added to the current project by
  reference.
